=========

Deep Image is a memory workout game of non-profit project. We hope to help slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease. All you have to do is to match the images by tapping on the cards.

Features include:
- 5 albums of 141 images
- Voice for each image to consolidate memory
- 8 board sizes / levels from 2x2 to 5x6
- Localized into English and Traditional Chinese
- No advertising!

It is also a fun game for kids to learn vocabulary and for anybody to enjoy leisure time intelligently.
Your feedback is important to us as an encouragement for further development of this open source project.
